        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pork ribs</li>
            <li>mashed rock sugar</li>

            <li>star anise</li>
            <li>onion</li>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut ribs into 1 inch to 1.5 inch sections. Place in a pot with cold water. Bring to boil and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes. Transfer out and rinse under running warm water. Set aside to drain.</li>
            <li>Add cooking oil and smashed rock sugar in wok, heat over slow fire. Keep stirring until the sugar melts and turns into dark red.</li>
            <li>Add ribs to coat the sugar color, place light soy sauce, cooking wine and black vinegar. Continue stir fry for 2 minutes and pour enough hot water to cover and add ginger, green onion and star anise.</li>

        <h2>Swedish Pancakes</h2>
        <span>Origin: Sweden</span>
        <span>Source: Kristi</span>
        <span>Category: Breakfast</span>

        <img src="images/swedish-pancakes-platted.jpeg" width=400 alt="Three Swedish pancakes folded with a dusting of powdered sugar and berries on a plate. ">
        <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry jam, there is much to account for their popularity.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>vanilla</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter or other desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more information about making ahead of time and storing in the refrigerator or freezer.</li>
        </ol>
